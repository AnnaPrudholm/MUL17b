        		<h3>PERSONAL</h3>
        		<p>My name is Anna and I am 21 years old. I live in Lyngby where I was also born and raised. I am currently at the first semester of studying Multimedia Design at Cphbusiness in Lyngby.</p> 
				<h3>WHY MULTIMEDIA DESIGN?</h3>
				<p>I have always been a very creative person and ever since I was a child I have been dreaming about pursuing some kind of creative profession. I have considered many different options, but in the end I decided that Multimedia Design was the perfect choice for me. I love the way it is both creative and IT-based.</p>
				<h3>INTERESTS</h3>
				<p>I am very interested in fashion, music, social media and marketing and I hope that I will be able to work in a cross-area of these things. I would love to work in marketing or PR for one of the big fashion brands in the future or with graphic design of some sort. </p>
