        		<h3>ABOUT THE PROJECT</h3>
        		<p> On a field trip to Copenhagen, we were told to take pictures of bridges in the area. The assignment was to manipulate the picture using Photoshop and the following had to be manipulated:<br><br>
        		- Remove an element and fill in the background. <br>
        		- Add an element in a way that it looks like it was there when the picture was taken. <br>
        		- Adjust the lighting or add a filter to change the mood of picture. <br>
        		- Crop and, if necessary, align the picture. <br>
        		- Change the format to 4:3 and save the picture in a size â‰¦ 1 M pixel.</p>
        		<h3>WORK</h3>
        		<p><i>Remove an element and fill in the background:</i> <br>
        		I removed a pillar from the water and the reflection of the pillar in the railing of the bridge. I filled the background in with diffent tools. I used the patch tool, the clone stamp tool and the spot healing brush tool, I also copied some of the elements in the background and used to cover the pillar. <br><br>
        		<i>Add an element in a way that it looks like it was there when the picture was taken:</i> <br>
        		I added a seagull on top of the building. I cropped it out from another picture and copied it in. Then I added a color overlay and a gradient overlay so the seagull was more blended in with the background and looked more natual. <br><br>
        		<i>Adjust the lighting or add a filter to change the mood of picture:</i> <br>
        		I choose to keep the orinal mood of Copenhagen on a rainy day, but to give the picture more depth i have changed the color balance, the brightness/contrast and the exposure a bit. <br><br>
        		<i>Crop and, if necessary, align the picture:</i> <br>
        		I used the straigtening tool to straighten the picture and then I cropped the picture to make the brigde and the building the focus.</p>
